**Gate-level simulation**

Gate-level simulation is a method used in digital design to verify the functionality and correctness of a digital circuit at the level of individual logic gates. In gate-level simulation, the behavior of each gate in the circuit is simulated, taking into account their logical functions, timing characteristics, and interconnections. Input signals are applied to the primary inputs of the circuit, and the resulting output signals are observed at the primary outputs. This simulation process allows designers to evaluate the circuit's behavior under different input conditions, verify its compliance with design specifications, and detect any errors or discrepancies before the circuit is fabricated.
